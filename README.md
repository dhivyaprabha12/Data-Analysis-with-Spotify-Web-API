# Data-Analysis-with-Spotify-Web-API
Data analytics project using the Spotify API, collecting track metadata with Python and Spotipy and storing it in MySQL. I used SQL to identify top songs, calculate average popularity, and filter by duration, and visualized results with Matplotlib. This strengthened my skills in APIs, databases, and data visualization with real-world music data.
