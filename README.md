# Data-Analysis-with-Spotify-Web-API
Data analytics project using the Spotify API, collecting track metadata with Python and Spotipy and storing it in MySQL. I used SQL to identify top songs, calculate average popularity, and filter by duration, and visualized results with Matplotlib. This strengthened my skills in APIs, databases, and data visualization with real-world music data.

 **Overview**

This project explores music analytics using the Spotify Web API, focusing on extracting and analyzing metadata from my favorite tracks. The goal was to convert real-world music data into meaningful insights through a combination of Python, MySQL, and data visualization.

 **Features**
 
- API integration using Spotipy to fetch track metadata
- Storage of track information in a MySQL database
- Analysis of key metrics such as:
- Most popular track
- Average popularity
- Duration patterns
- Data visualizations using Matplotlib
- Automation to process multiple track URLs from a file

**Tech Stack**

- Python
- Spotify Web API (Spotipy)
- MySQL
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

**Workflow**

- Extract track IDs from Spotify URLs
- Fetch metadata (artist, album, duration, popularity, etc.)
- Store data in a structured MySQL table
- Run SQL queries for analytical insights
- Visualize key metrics using bar charts
